# Core principles
# Examples
## GNU/Linux distributions
When we talk about [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] distributions:
- [[GNU]] is the software utilites, libraries and tools
- [[Linux]] is the [[Operating System#Kernel|Kernel]]: this means that the Kernel is Linux-based, but there might be some customizations to it
- The distribution adds some customizations to the Linux Kernel, as well as new tools apart from GNU tools (e.g. [[Linux#APT|APT]] for Ubuntu). That's why we consider that the distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) is itself an [[Operating System]]
