# Core principles
## Definition
_GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix_
It is a **project** with the purpose of turning **Open-Source** [[UNIX|UNIX-like]] [[Operating System|Operating Systems]] into **Open-Source** Operating Systems by implementing **free-software** components such as libraries, packages, tools, games and applications. For example, the **grep** command, the **GCC compiler** (which stands for GNU Compiler Collection) or the **Bash shell** are examples of GNU utilities.

The term _GNU_ stands for _GNU is Not Unix_ because It differs from UNIX by being **free software**.
Therefore, GNU can be mixed in conjunction with a UNIX-like Operating System: e.g. **GNU/[[Linux]]**, providing the classic [[#Bash]] shell.
Summarizing, when we talk about **GNU/Linux**:
- GNU would be the [[Operating System]] software utilities, libraries, tools...
- Linux would be the [[Operating System]] itself (i.e. the [[Operating System#Kernel|Kernel]])
## GPG public and private keys
_GPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard_
It uses the **PGP Standard**.
## GNU Makefile
It is a Script called `Makefile` that serves for managing the build process of a software project. It specifies, with rules, which parts of the code files to compile and how.
Commonly used for [[C]] and [[C++]] projects, but other languages can use it.
### Example template
```Makefile
target: dependencies
	recipe
```
- `target` is the the name of the output file that is generated by the program (e.g. `file.o`)
- `dependencies` are the name of the input files which are used to generate the `target` (e.g. `main.c functions.h`)
- `recipe` is the set of commands needed to build the `target`
Example:
```Makefile
executable: file.o objects.o
	gcc -o executable file.o objects.o
	
file.o: main.c functions.h
	gcc -c main.c

objects.o: objects.c
	gcc -c objects.c
```
In this way, for example, to build `file.o`, run [[#make (run Makefile target)|make]] specifying the `<target> = file.o`. To build the `executable` file, the same with `<target> = executable`.
If you run `make` without specifying any target, the **first target** in the `Makefile` will be executed by default. That's why the executable target is often the first one in the target list.
### Phony Targets
Instead of specifying output filenames, you can specify a rulename such as _clean_ or whatever, which is not a filename.
To prevent Makefile from considering it is a file, you must set the target as a **Phony Target**:
```Makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm *.o temp
```

However, it can be the name of the rule (such as _clean_).
## Bash
_Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell_
It is a [[Operating System#Shell|CLI Shell]] with its own shell-specific language. It is the classic shell you can find inside [[Linux]]:
![[Bash-shell.png]]
### Useful commands
Some commands that are provided by GNU Bash are the following. However, you can also run [[UNIX#UNIX-CLI standard commands]] (i.e. Bash is not limited to just GNU commands).
Every command is a binary file (located in [[Linux#/bin]] directory).
#### echo (Print text to the terminal)
```shell
echo "Hello, World!"
```
#### read (Read input from the user)
```shell
read -p "Enter your name: " <name>
```
##### Read some string and store it in Bash variable
If you run:
```shell
read store_variable
```
The Shell will let you write anything. What you write will be stored in ```store_variable```. Then, you can ```echo store_variable``` and see the content.
You can also run:
```shell
read store_variable <<< "example"
```
To store a constant value inside ```store_variable```.
##### String tokenization with read
Tokenize the string and store the tokens in some variable with name ```tokenized_string_variable_name```:
```shell
IFS=<delimiter_char> read -a tokenized_string_variable_name <<< <input_string>
```
With ```-a```, you specify the output to be an array.
Iterate over each token and print them:
```
for token in "${tokenized_string_variable_name[@]}"; do
> command to run
> done (to finish the loop)
```
For instance:
```shell
IFS=',' read -a tokenized_string_variable_name <<< "hello,goodby,hello"
```
After running the previous command:
```shell
for token in "${tokenized_string_variable_name[@]}"; do echo $token; done
```
#### grep (Search for patterns in files or command output)
```shell
grep <pattern>
```
For example, `<pattern>` might be a [[Regular Expressions|Regular expression]]. This command will show the lines matching the specified pattern.
Interesting flags:
- `-B <n>` (show `n` lines `B`efore context): will show the previous `n` lines of the resulting matching line. Example usage: `grep -B 3 metrics(.*)`
- `-A <m>` (show `m` lines `A`fter context): will show the following `m` lines of the resulting matching line. Example usage: `grep -A 4 metrics(.*)`
#### sed (Stream editor for text transformation)
#### find (Search for files in a directory hierarchy)
```shell
find <directory> -name "..."
```
Interesting flags:
- `-type f`: search for files
- `-type d`: search for directories
Example: find all files from the current directory with `.py` extension:
```shell
find . -type f -name "*.py"
```
#### chmod (Change file or directory permissions)
##### Specifying Octal Notation
```shell
sudo chmod <octal_number> <target_file_or_directory>
```
Where `octal_number` consists of three digits:
- The first digit represents permissions for the owner of the file [[Linux#File owner]].
- The second digit represents permissions for the [[Linux#Group owner]] that the file belongs to.
- The third digit represents permissions for **others** (users who are not the owner and not in the group).
The [[Linux#Permissions]] have a representing number:
- `r (read) = 4`
- `w (write) = 2`
- `x (execute) = 1`
Thus, each digit in `octal_number` is the sum of the values of the permissions we would like to grant.
For example, if we want to grant all permissions (`rwx`) for File owner but no permissions for the Group owner or others, then the value must be `700`, which means `(rwx) --- ---`.
#### chown (change ownership)
You can change the [[Linux#File owner]] with:
```shell
sudo chown <new_file_owner> <filename>
```
#### /bin/bash (execute a Bash Script)
```shell
/bin/bash <script-name.sh>
```
Or:
```shell
./<script-name.sh>
```
#### gawk: a GNU extension of AWK
#### gpg
To convert from ASCII OpenPGP public-private key in `.asc` format to `.gpg`. For example, input can be:

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

```

```shell
gpg --dearmor <ascii_file.asc>
```
Interesting flags:
- `-o`: to specify the path and filename of the `.gpg` output file

#### make (run Makefile target)
```shell
make <target>
```
#### df
Displays [[Operating System#Mount point|Mounted points]] in the file system, which can be from:
- [[Linux#LV|Logical Volumes]]
- [[Operating System#Partition|Partitions]]
This command is available in most [[UNIX]]-like [[Operating System|Operating Systems]]. However, we have placed it in GNU because there are some flags and options (such as `-h`) that are from GNU.
```shell
df
```
#### mapfile (turn [[#Bash]] output into an array)
Whenever you want to take some command output and store each line as an element in an array, you can use `mapfile`:
```shell
mapfile -t <my_array> < <(<command>)
```
#### unzip (uncompress `.zip` file)
```shell
unzip <file.zip>
```
#### tar (tape archive)
_Was originally created to write multiple files onto tape storage_
It can be used for either compressing files in a single `.tar` file or extract files from `.tar` file.
##### Archiving (compressing) files
You can package an entire directory into a single `.tar` file. To do so, you have to instruct `tar` command to compress files using flags:
- `-c`: stands for "create a new archive"
- `-z`: stands for "GZIP `.tar.gz` compression type" (optional)
- `-j`; stands for "BZIP2 `.tar.bz2` compression type" (optional)
- `-f`: stands for "filename"
- `-v`: stands for "verbose output" (optional)
The simplest use case is:
```shell
tar -cf <filename.tar(.gz/.bz2)> <path>
```
##### Extracting files
To do so, you have to instruct `tar` command to compress files using flags:
- `-x`: stands for "extract the files from an archive"
- `-z`: stands for "GZIP `.tar.gz` decompression type" (optional)
- `-j`; stands for "BZIP2 `.tar.bz2` compression type" (optional)
- `-f`: stands for "filename"
- `-v`: stands for "verbose output" (optional)
The simplest use case is:
```shell
tar -xf <filename.tar>
```
