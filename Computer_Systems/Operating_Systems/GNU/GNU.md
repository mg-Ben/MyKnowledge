# Core principles
## Definition
_GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix_
It is a **project** with the purpose of turning **Open-Source** [[UNIX|UNIX-like]] [[Operating System|Operating Systems]] into **Open-Source** Operating Systems by implementing **free-software** components such as libraries, packages, tools, games and applications. For example, the **grep** command, the **GCC compiler** (which stands for GNU Compiler Collection) or the **Bash shell** are examples of GNU utilities.

The term _GNU_ stands for _GNU is Not Unix_ because It differs from UNIX by being **free software**.
Therefore, GNU can be mixed in conjunction with a UNIX-like Operating System: e.g. **GNU/[[Linux]]**, providing the classic [[#Bash]] shell.
## Bash
_Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell_
It is a [[Operating System#Shell|CLI Shell]] with its own shell-specific language. It is the classic shell you can find inside [[Linux]]:
