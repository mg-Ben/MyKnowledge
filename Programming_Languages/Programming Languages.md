## Compiler

## Concepts
### Modulatization
It involves dividing the code into multiple Scripts or files, each one with its own functionality.
### Data structure
It is a datatype which consists of several fields, each one with its own datatype (which can be also a data structure itself). For example, a [[JSON]] object is a data structure, or a [[Java#Class]].
A data structure may also contain methods (i.e. functions that serves for retrieving data for that data structure, like [[Java#Methods]]).
