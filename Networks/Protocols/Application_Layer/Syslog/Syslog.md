# Core principles
_Syslog stands for System Logging_
It is an [[OSI Model|Application Layer]] protocol and standard used to send [[Operating System]] messages (such as event messages) to a syslog server. Therefore, uses [[Internet#Client-Server communication|C/S]] communication.
Many devices (computers, printers, routers...) implement Syslog standard.
The current version of Syslog protocol has got the [[Layer architecture#RFC (Request For Comments)|RFC]] 5424, whilst the older one was 3164. The Syslog RFC comprises several definitions, the architecture or the syslog message format (headers and message fields), among others.
