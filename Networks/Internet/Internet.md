# Core principles
Internet has two main definitions:

- Interconnection of **Hardware and Software** components ("Nuts and bolts") - It's like an objective approach
- Network infrastructure which provides **services to distributed applications** - It's like an subjective approach

The first one is the objective view of Internet. The second one is more subjective: what we can do with those components.
# The Internet boundary
## Terminal systems
Internet can be depicted as a huge network of interconnected devices. In the Internet slang, we call **Terminal Systems** (also known as **Hosts**) to the end to end communication between two parts, because that communication takes place on the boundaries of Internet.

Those terminals might be:
- User's machines
- Servers
- Network balancers, firewalls, switches, gateways...
And they can communicate each other in different ways.
### Client-Server communication
- **Server**: a running process which is usually indefinitely awaiting for connections and which provides a service to the client (e.g. a webpage)
- **Client**: the process that wants to be served and sends requests to the server (e.g. our web browser-background process, when we are surfing the internet)
### Peer-to-Peer communication
