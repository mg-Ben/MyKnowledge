# Core principles
Internet has two main definitions:

- Interconnection of Hardware and Software components ("Nuts and bolts") - It's like an objective approach
- Network infrastructure which provides services to distributed applications - It's like an subjective approach

The first one is the objective view of Internet. The second one is more subjective: what we can do with those components.
