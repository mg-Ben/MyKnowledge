It is an Open-Source monitoring system for organizations. In other words, it is a software application or web application to explore monitoring data about the organization's infrastructure.
- For example, you can explore data about [[Operating System#CPU|CPU]], [[Operating System#Main memory (RAM)|RAM usage]], Network latency and Ping status of some machine specifying the [[IP#IP address|IP address]]
- Nagios XI also allows you to explore data at higher level: service (group of machines)
